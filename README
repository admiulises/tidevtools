tidevtools from Bill Dawson

Includes a script to make a project, and a script to "eclipsify" a project.

Here's how I use it, and I recommend you do too:

1) Clone this repository.
2) Copy tidevtools_settings.py.sample -> tidevtools_settings.py.
3) Open tidevtools_settings.py and change the values -- I think they're self-explanatory.
4) chmod +x *.py
5) Make life easy on yourself and make some alias.  I do this...
alias mp="/Users/bill/projects/tidevtools/ti_makeproj.py"
alias ec="/Users/bill/projects/tidevtools/ti_eclipsify.py"
