tidevtools from Bill Dawson

So far only 'mp', a python script to make a Titanium mobile project.  Tested only on OS X.
Just give it a project name and it sets up the project folders and makes the entry in the sqlite
database maintained by Titanium Developer so that you'll see the project next time you open Developer.

One long piece of non-modular python code!

I wrote it feverishly today (09 Sep 2010) because I'm getting so tired of typing in 
all those fields when I create a new mobile project in Titanium Developer.  I create
a lot of projects to test trouble tickets, new features, etc.  

UPDATE: 
Now includes also 'ec', to make a Titanium mobile project ready to be imported to
Eclipse.  NOTE: will become obsolete when Titanium mobile's android_native_refactor
branch is pulled into master branch, because there will then be many changes that
affect the ability to pull the project into Eclipse.  I'll need to update it then.
